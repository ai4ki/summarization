    "# Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "*Updated: 01/27/2022*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you to summarize texts by using two different approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is called 'Extractive Summarization' (ES). As its name suggests, ES employs algorithms, which try to identify and extract the most relevant sentences from a text. ES is a computationally  efficient and fast summarization approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach is called 'Abstractive Summarization' (AS). This approach is based on (large) language models (LLM) for which the so called transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard. Having 'seen' enough pairs of text and a summary during training and leveraging its general language capabilities, an LLM can generate a summary that can contain original sentences verbatim alongside rewritten or newly generated text. In contrast to ES, AS is very compute expensive.      \n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific texts strongly differ from most other texts in structure, form, and style. As LLMs are usually trained on vast troves of diverese texts scraped off the internet, we can't expect them to deal particularly well with scientific literature (unless we fine-tune them for this task). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is, therefore, strongly recommended to first use ES algorithms as they return original sentences from the text. AS might, instead, be a good starting point in case you have to write a summary, say, for a project proposal.     \n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, this is how to go about it: In order to execute a piece of code, click inside a cell (the ones with `[]` to the left) and press Shift+Enter. Wait until the cell is done--that's when the `*` in `[]` turned into a number--and move on to the next cell.\n",
    "\n",
